# Charms

Charms is a required subject taught at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, in which the students learn to perform different spells on objects or individuals. During the class, the professor Filius Flitwick created different challenges for the students to do in a certain amount of time. The main objective of this activity is to teach the students to perform a spell by following specific instructions and score as many points as they can for their corresponding houses.
